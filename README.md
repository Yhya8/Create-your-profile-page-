# Create-your-profile-page-
This is my profile page and I made it open source for everyone and for who want to use it.
Enjoy !

Tip : To link the nav-bar section with the other pages use this pattern : index.html , Projects.html , Contact,html
add html after every name or from the link when oppning the file on the browser.

Example from the browser : 
file:///C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/xCuzSkillz.xyz/index[.html] add html after index with out []
